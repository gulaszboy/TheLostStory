Humans and elves have always lived in peace, they worked with
each other and lived in the same cities. It has changed with the
orc raid, their strength was large enough to beat the Old kingdoms...
The elves left the people, and hidden in the woods,
they became wild forest elves. There were clumsy among people
who were killing each other... 
Some were trying to oppose the orcs, but they weren't strong 
enough to deal with them. They were caught by orcs and passed to
heavy work in mines, all insubordination was rewarded with a 
severe flogging. People living in the caves for years slowly 
got used to living in the dark.
 
Everything changes with the accidental killing of an orc by a young man...

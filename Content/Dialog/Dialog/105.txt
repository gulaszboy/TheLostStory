I'm reporting that I did the job.

Okay, I was thinking a lot about what you said, and I've searched old maps.

Really? And?

I think there is a way out.

What way? When are we escaping?

Not so fast boy, it's dangerous out there, we can't handle it.

I've beaten orc, I can handle everything!

You were just lucky.

Okay, so show me the way!

You can't do it on your own, do you have some friends who can help you?

Of course, I'm going to get them!

Wait, spies can be everywhere!

Then what to do?

Speak only to the ones you trust the most.

Okay got it!

No! First you have to ask them what they think about possible escape, but be careful.

So they won't guess anything?

Exactly, it will be better for us if no one suspects anything. We will go if you organize people, but only then!

Ok, I'm on my way!

Take care of yourself.

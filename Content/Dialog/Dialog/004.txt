Why weren't you with everyone?

I was looking for young bats to eat.

It is getting harder to find some food in this mine, we won't be able to survive here.

I'm afraid you're right.

By the way, did you hear the latest news?

No, what is the news?

One of us has revolted, and didn't want to work.

I'm not suprised...

Don't think that you are a hero!

You're right, but if there was a way out...

To defeat the orc army? Are you crazy?! They have fortifications, and they are stronger!

To get to the headquarters, and exit somehow from there secretly...

You are mad, will you take care of this lazy worker.
Do I have to deal with you both?

Got it, I am going...

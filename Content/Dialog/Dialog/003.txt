cuz... cuz... cuz...

Say it boldly, maybe I can help you.

Sir, i think I'm dying...

Why do you think so?

I haven't eaten anything for 3 days and I'm so hungry now!

Where are your parents?

They are dead Sir..

In that case, I'll take care of you!

Earlier, one lady has been helping me, but she stopped coming...

So now, I'll be your guardian, may it be?

Sir, will you disappear too?

Don't talk like this, now quietly, don't cry, I won't disappear.
Well, I'm just going to bring you a piece of meat

I won't let you go!

Why?

You will go and won't come back to me...

Don't worry, I'll return, I promise.

Well, ok, thank you Sir...

-Okay, the work is done!

-So, the body is hidden?

-Of corse, you doubted me?

-I knew you can handle it. Where did you hide it?

-Behind this big boulder, in the old part of the mine.

-Are you sure no one will see him?

-Absolutely.

-I think I can trust you, but don't mention it to anyone!

-I wouldn't dare.

-Actually, why weren't you with everyone?

-I was looking for young bats to eat.

-It is getting harder to find some food in this mine, we won't endure here very long.

-I'm afraid of this.

-By the way, did you hear the latest news?

-No, what is the news?

-One of us has revolted, and didn't want to work.

-I'm not suprised...

-Don't think that you are a hero!

-You're right, but if there was a way out...

-To defeat the orc army? Are you crazy?! They have fortifications, and are stronger!

-To get to the headquarters, and exit somehow from there secretly...

-You are sick, will you take care of this lazy worker.
-Do I have to deal with you both?

-Got it, I'am going...

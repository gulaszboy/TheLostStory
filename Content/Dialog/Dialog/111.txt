How are the preparations going?

I have collected a group, we can go...

Are you sure all of them are trustworthy?

You can trust them.

Well then, old maps say that there should be a switch here...
Oh there it is!
(wzzzrgggghhh)

Really, for so many years you didn't know that in your quarters there is a hidden exit from the mine?

This isn't exactly the way out, the tunnel leads to the back of the orc headquarters.
That's why I told you to gather the team...

I see the task won't be as easy as I thought.

There is no time to waste, I'll be waiting with your friends right at the back entrance to the orc quarter.
You should look around these tunnels, maybe you'll find something interesting...
